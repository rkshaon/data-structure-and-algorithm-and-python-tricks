# OOP in Python
Object oriented programming (OOP) in Python is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to model real-world entities and their relations. Some main features of OOP in Python are:
- Classes
- Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Modularity

# Class
In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances) that share similar attributes and behavior. It provides a way to define and organize code in a structured manner, allowing you to create reusable and modular code.
